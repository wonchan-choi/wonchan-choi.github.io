<h2>Project Description</h2>

The Mobile Digital Library Accessibility and Usability Guidelines (mDLAUG) is a set of accessibility and usability guidelines created for digital library (DL) developers to support blind and visually impaired (BVI) users who rely on screen readers to interact with DLs in the mobile environment. The mDLAUG was developed based on the types of help-seeking situations identified by user studies that investigated BVI users’ interactions with DLs using diverse types of mobile devices (i.e., iPhone, iPad, Android phone, and Android tablet). The mDLAUG will be further revised and enhanced based on feedback from key stakeholders of DLs, including users, scholars/experts, and DL developers. The mDLAUG is organized into 10 categories and 23 types of help-seeking situations BVI users encountered in their interactions with DLs.
