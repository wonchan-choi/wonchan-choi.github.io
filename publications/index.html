This study investigated how users assess the credibility of information on social question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) platforms. The study builds on a social Q&amp;A-specific web credibility framework (Choi et al., 2023), integrating a two-dimensional model of credibility—trustworthiness and expertise (Hovland et al., 1953)—and three types of web credibility cues and heuristics—author or community, content, and design (Fogg, 2003). Methodology. Using online survey data from 598 users, we employed exploratory factor analysis to identify 10 credibility criteria across three categories: author or community, content, and design. One-sample t-tests assessed the perceived importance of these criteria, and multiple regression analyses examined their associations with two core credibility dimensions—trustworthiness and expertise—while controlling for user characteristics. Findings. Although the identified criteria were rated highly overall in conceptual importance (M = 3.92), only six—community reputation, appropriate design, moderation, engaging design, reference reliability, and decency—were significantly associated with perceived trustworthiness, expertise, or both. In contrast, traditionally valued criteria related to answer quality or author characteristics had limited predictive power. These findings support a refined, empirically grounded eight-criterion framework for credibility in social Q&amp;A environments. Originality. This study offers a data-driven update to a 21-criterion credibility model, identifying the most influential criteria in terms of conceptual importance and applicability in evaluating the trustworthiness and expertise of information on peer-based, collaborative platforms. Also, it suggests potential to extend the framework to emerging environments such as generative artificial intelligence, where criteria like reference reliability remain relevant.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#1165D4"> <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23301643" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="xie2025investigating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigating the interactions between individuals with disabilities and information retrieval systems: A review of help-seeking situations, search tactics, and design recommendations</div> <div class="author"> Iris Xie, <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Hyun Seung Lee, Bo Hyun Hong, and Shengang Wang </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24997" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>People with disabilities face barriers when engaging with information retrieval (IR) systems due to designs that overlook their needs. This systematic literature review explores research for individuals with disabilities interacting with IR systems. Relevant theories concerning disabilities were examined, and the gap model was used as the theoretical framework that guided the review. This review covers relevant research published from 2000 to 2023, focusing on user groups with sensory, cognitive, and motor impairments. The main topics are help-seeking situations encountered by these user groups in various IR systems due to system design not meeting user needs, and search tactics applied by users with different types of disabilities corresponding to various help-seeking situations. Design recommendations for IR systems and platforms were also examined. Key limitations in existing research and the authors’ reflections are highlighted, including a lack of theories on the interactions between people with disabilities and IR systems, imbalanced research on and misclassification between different types of impairments, unclear distinctions between accessibility and usability, unexplored IR issues in mobile environments, and inadequate existing IR system designs, along with the challenges posed by one-size-fits-all design.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 college students in the United States. Interview transcripts were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis method. The study identified various types of academic tasks for which students used ChatGPT, including writing, programming, and learning. Guided by two models of credibility assessment Hilligoss and Rieh (2008); Metzger (2007), six factors influencing students’ motivation and ability to assess the credibility of GenAI-generated information were identified (e.g., task salience, social pressure). We also identified 9 constructs (e.g., refinedness, explainability), 5 heuristics (e.g., inter- and intrasystem consistency heuristics), and 10 cues (e.g., version and tone) used by students to assess the credibility of GenAI-generated information.

This study represents one of the most comprehensive research projects, investigating accessibility issues, especially help-seeking situations BVI users face in their DL search processes. One hundred and twenty BVI users were recruited to search for information in six DLs on four types of mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, Android phone, and Android tablet), and multiple data collection methods were employed: questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, transaction logs, and interviews. This paper reports part of a large-scale study, including the categories of help-seeking situations BVI users face in their interactions with DLs, focusing on seven types of help-seeking situations related to visual interactions on mobile platforms: difficulty finding a toggle-based search feature, difficulty understanding a video feature, difficulty navigating items on paginated sections, difficulty distinguishing collection labels from thumbnails, difficulty recognizing the content of images, difficulty recognizing the content of graphs, and difficulty interacting with multilayered windows. Moreover, corresponding design recommendations are also proposed: placing meaningful labels for icon-based features in an easy-to-access location, offering intuitive and informative video descriptions for video players, providing structure information about a paginated section, separating collection/item titles from thumbnail descriptions, incorporating artificial intelligence image/graph recognition mechanisms, and limiting screen reader interactions to active windows.

Although previous research has examined various attributes of high-quality information on social Q&amp;A sites (e.g., best answers), relatively less attention has been paid to what affects users’ credibility assessments of information in the social Q&amp;A context. The present study developed a social Q&amp;A platform-specific framework for web credibility assessment, including 21 criteria under six types of web credibility, based on a literature analysis and case study of two online Q&amp;A communities, Stack Exchange and Wikipedia Reference Desk. Using the selected sites’ policies and guidelines (n = 46) as the source of evidence, the case study revealed that content-related attributes (e.g., evidence-based, pertinence) were most frequently identified (12 of 21 criteria) as potential cues and heuristics for web credibility assessments of social Q&amp;A sites, followed by author-related (five of 21; e.g., reputation) and design-related (four of 21; e.g., engaging design) factors. Design-related criteria were rarely included in previous models of web credibility on social Q&amp;A or similar peer-knowledge production platforms. However, our findings showing that both Stack Exchange and Wikipedia Reference Desk have policies regarding all four design-related criteria in our framework—engaging design, moderation, design appropriateness, and ease of use—indicate the potential influences of design features on users’ web credibility assessment on social Q&amp;A sites. Some differences emerged between the two cases, such as policies regarding the answerer’s credentials or semantic accuracy that are present on Wikipedia Reference Desk but absent on Stack Exchange. Such differences in the sites’ policies reflect how they position themselves as social Q&amp;A communities—Wikipedia, of which Wikipedia Reference Desk is a part, as an encyclopedia, and Stack Exchange as a community-based platform for learning, sharing knowledge, and building careers of users.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#1165D4"> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AS</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="zheng2023exploration" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An exploration of robot-mediated tai chi exercise for older adults</div> <div class="author"> Zhi Zheng, Hyunkyoung Oh, Mayesha Mim, <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, and Yura Lee </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Applied Sciences</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.3390/app13095306" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023-AP.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this fast-aging society, many older adults fail to meet the required level of exercise due to trainer shortages. Therefore, we developed a robot tutor to investigate the feasibility of robot-mediated exercise for older adults. Twenty older adults participated in an experimental study. A pre-exercise survey was used to assess their background. Each participant experienced a 30-min robot-led Tai Chi exercise followed by a post-exercise survey to evaluate the easiness of following the robot and expectations for future robot design. Participants’ Tai Chi performances were evaluated in terms of completion and accuracy. Associations between the surveys and the performance were also analyzed. All participants completed the study. Fifteen out of the twenty subjects had at least one chronic condition, and most practiced Tai Chi before the study but had never interacted with a robot. On average, the participants scored 93.09 and 85.21 out of 100 for movement completion and accuracy, respectively. Their initial movement accuracy was correlated with their attitude towards exercise. Most subjects reported that they could follow the robot’s movements and speeches well and were interested in using a robot tutor in the community. The study demonstrated the initial feasibility of robot-led Tai Chi exercise for older adults.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.asist.org/meetings-events/am/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2023exploring" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exploring applications and user experience with generative AI tools: A content analysis of reddit posts on ChatGPT</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Yan Zhang, and Besiki Stvilia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.823" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023-ASIST-ShortPaper.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023-ASIST-ShortPaper-Slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As part of a larger project, this paper reports on preliminary findings of a study exploring use cases of ChatGPT and associated behaviors and experiences among users of an online forum. Posts on a ChatGPT-related forum on Reddit (n = 452) were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. This paper reports on themes relevant to this study, including the types of tasks for which users used ChatGPT, user experiences, and perceived impacts of ChatGPT. ChatGPT was often used to facilitate various writing tasks (e.g., writing an essay), academic tasks (e.g., finding scientific references for a research paper), everyday tasks (e.g., creating a meal plan), and conversational purposes (e.g., having a simulated conversation about a past event). Users expressed positive (e.g., excited, amazed) and negative (e.g., fooled, concerned) feelings toward the technology. They raised various issues and problems with ChatGPT at the content (e.g., inaccuracy, incompletes) and system (e.g., unavailability, instability) levels. Users discussed the perceived impacts of ChatGPT on individuals (e.g., unemployment) and society (e.g., AI divide). Study findings can inform the design of policies and guidelines for mitigating AI problems and promoting the effective and ethical use of emerging AI technologies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.asist.org/meetings-events/am/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2023preliminary" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Preliminary findings on developing a scale for credibility assessment on interactive web platforms</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Liya Zhu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.901" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023-ASIST-Abstract.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023-ASIST-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This poster introduces an ongoing project to develop a scale for measuring information credibility on current and newly emerging interactive web platforms.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted with survey responses from college students (NN = 141) who assessed credibility markers of a website they normally visit to address health concerns. A 4-factor solution emerged as the best summary of the data: (a) content, (b) interaction design, (c) information design, and (d) source. Identified components were used in a linear model to explore the effects of different web credibility types on perceptual, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes. Alongside content-related attributes (e.g., recency of the information), interaction design-related elements (e.g., ability to interact with other users) were significantly associated with most dependent variables examined in the study (e.g., trust in the information on the site, willingness to follow the advice, and willingness to recommend the site to others). Current results imply that users count on not only content-related cues or heuristics, but also interactive design features as helpful tools for mobilizing social resources (e.g., fellow users) to validate online health information.

The present study analyzed national survey data collected by the Pew Research Center in 2016 based on Savolainen’s ELIS model. The model’s core concept, mastery of life, was measured in terms of general coping style to find information (cognitive vs. affective) and expectations about the findability of necessary information (optimistic vs. pessimistic). Weighted multiregression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between mastery of life and ELIS behavior of older Americans (65 years or older) in terms of breath and depth of interest in everyday topics, holding other sociocultural and demographic factors constant. The results showed a cognitive, as opposed to affective, coping style was associated with a wider range of ELIS topics and a deeper level of interest in political and cultural topics. However, whether an individual had an optimistic or pessimistic perspective toward information seeking was not associated with the variety or depth of interest in everyday topics. Neither dimension was related to the depth of interest in sports topics.

Although the adoption of ICTs has dramatically changed the landscape of the health sector since the early 1950s, the benefits that ICTs could bring to dementia care have been relatively unexplored. Objective: This paper mined the research articles for insights into how relationships between ICTs and assistive technologies (ATs) in dementia care have been developed historically and should be cultivated in the future. Method: Using text-mining techniques, 2,030 journal articles regarding ATs in relation to ICTs in dementia care published from 1970 to 2020 were analyzed. The literature was retrieved from the Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and IEEE Xplore digital library. Results: Despite the active integration of ICTs in many other sectors, the literature demonstrated that research regarding ICT integration in ATs for dementia interventions occurred only after the 1990s. The analysis results also indicate that studies have moved toward supporting the aging-in-place of people with dementia, encompassing major research interests such as assisting with daily activities of living, modifying the home, and promoting recreational activities. A research gap was also identified in technology adoption to support the social interactions of those with dementia, which is a key part of enhancing the quality of life. Conclusion: The research that addressed ICT integration with ATs for dementia care has been evolving and moving from issues of safety and security to maintaining autonomy of people with dementia in their own place.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#1165D4"> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jag" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JAG</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="lee2022respite" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Respite service use among dementia and nondementia caregivers: Findings from the National Caregiving in the US 2015 Survey</div> <div class="author"> Yura Lee, <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, and Min Sook Park </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Applied Gerontology</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648221075620" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This study examined factors related to respite service use among caregivers and further tested the moderating effect of dementia caregiver status in these relationships using nationally representative U.S. data. Logistic regression analyses were conducted among 1203 caregivers (276 dementia and 927 nondementia caregivers). Caregivers’ race and ethnicity as a predisposing factor, caregivers’ self-rated health as an enabling factor, and care recipients’ living arrangement and functional limitations as need factors were significantly related to respite service use. Moreover, dementia caregiver status moderated the association between enabling factors (i.e., household income, work status, and self-rated health) and respite service use. Our findings imply that dementia caregivers may be more in need of respite service use than nondementia caregivers when they have limited enabling factors (e.g., lower household income, nonworking status, poorer health). Policy and practice efforts that specifically support enabling factors are suggested to promote more respite service use among dementia caregivers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.ischools.org/iconference" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iConf</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2022developing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Developing a theoretical framework for web credibility assessment—A case of social Q&amp;A sites: preliminary findings</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Besiki Stvilia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>iConference Proceedings</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/123089" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2022-iConf-Abstract.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEhqiOi3d_I32uTkx8DWrYtmA_uJ6jIN/view?usp=drive_link" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Video</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2022-iConf-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As part of a larger study, this poster reports on preliminary findings of efforts to develop a theoretical framework for assessing the credibility of information on social question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) sites.

Specifically, 21 criteria identified by the literature analysis were categorized into one of six types of web credibility assessments—operator (author) trustworthiness, operator (author) expertise, con-tent trustworthiness, content expertise, design trustworthiness, and design expertise—to develop an information platform type-specific framework of in-formation credibility. Results show that existing criteria used in the literature have focused primarily on content-related attributes (eg, evidence-based, structural completeness, and semantic clarity and comprehensive-ness), but less on operator (author)-related attributes (eg, credentials) or de-sign features (eg, interactive design, appropriateness of design, ease of use).

To inform the design and development of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) for people living with multiple chronic conditions, this paper examines features mentioned in developers’ descriptions and user reviews of mHealth apps, along with users’ attitudes toward associated features. Materials and methods: Eleven top apps for diabetes and hypertension were identified from Google Play as of January 2020. Based on a stratified sampling strategy, 1,100 user reviews were selected to form the final dataset. Developers’ descriptions were also collected for analysis. Using the grounded theory approach, we developed a feature-oriented coding scheme, which was used to identify three levels of features mentioned in app descriptions and user reviews: feature group (the highest level), feature type (the second level), and individual feature (the lowest level). Users’ attitudes toward app features mentioned in user reviews were also analyzed. Results: Most top-rated apps for diabetes and hypertension under study were multifeatured, incorporating self-management, information sharing, and decision support features. At the feature-group level, most informative user reviews commented on features related to self-management, followed by decision support and information sharing. The four most frequently mentioned feature types were data entry, data export/import, data visualization, and assessment. Users expressed overwhelming positive attitudes toward app features across all feature categories. Based on users’ assessments of existing features and requests for additional features, design implications for app development are provided. Conclusions: Despite the diversity of app features provided by mHealth apps and users’ primarily positive attitudes toward existing app features, more comprehensive and personalized features are expected by app users to satisfy their health needs. Beyond identifying app features in user reviews, future research may seek more in-depth feedback from real-life patients for app development and design using methods like interviews and focus groups, to further enhance the overall quality of relevant mHealth apps to better support users.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.asist.org/meetings-events/am/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2020validating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Validating an extended typology of web credibility assessment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Manman Luo, and Sang-Yeon Kim </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.357" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2020-ASIST-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This methodology poster introduces an ongoing study seeking to validate an extended typology of web credibility assessments proposed by Choi and Stvilia (2015) using online surveys.

Finding “credible” health information from a plethora of information on the web may be more challenging for older adults, who have relatively less experience with the Internet. This article reports on the findings of an exploratory study of older adultsʼ credibility assessments of online health information. The data collected through semistructured interviews with 21 older adult Internet users in the United States were analyzed based on the extended typology of web credibility (Choi &amp; Stvilia, 2015, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66, 2399–2414). The findings of the study revealed that older adults paid closer attention to operator-related credibility cues and heuristics when judging the credibility of health information on the web, followed by content- and design-related ones. Also, the findings suggest that participants who were younger and used the Internet more frequently employed a wider variety of cues and heuristics to evaluate the credibility of online health information. Based on these findings, both theoretical and practical implications of the research and future research directions are discussed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#1165D4"> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JAMIA</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2020systematic" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A systematic review of mobile health technologies to support self-management of concurrent diabetes and hypertension</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Shengang Wang, Yura Lee, Hyunkyoung Oh, and Zhi Zheng </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa029" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2020-JAMIA.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Objective: This article reports results from a systematic literature review of the current state of mobile health (mHealth) technologies that have the potential to support self-management for people with diabetes and hypertension. The review aims to (a) characterize mHealth technologies used or described in the mHealth literature and (b) summarize their effects on self-management for people with diabetes and hypertension from the clinical and technical standpoints. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Online databases were searched in September 2018 to identify eligible studies for review that had been published since 2007, the start of the smartphone era. Data were extracted from included studies based on the PICOS framework. Results: Of the 11 studies included for in-depth review, 5 were clinical research examining patient health outcomes and 6 were technology-focused studies examining users’ experiences with mHealth technologies under development. The most frequently used mHealth technology features involved self-management support (n = 11) followed by decision support (n = 6) and shared decision-making (n = 6). Most clinical studies reported benefits associated with mHealth interventions. These included reported improvements in objectively measured patient health outcomes (n = 3) and perceptual or behavioral outcomes (n = 4). Discussion: Although most studies reported promising results in terms of the effects of mHealth interventions on patient health outcomes and experience, the strength of evidence was limited by the study designs. Conclusion: More randomized clinical trials are needed to examine the promise and limitations of mHealth technologies as assistive tools to facilitate the self-management of highly prevalent comorbidity of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ConfProc</abbr> </div> <div id="oh2019challenges" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Challenges in self-management among older adults with hypertension and diabetes</div> <div class="author"> Hyunkyoung Oh, Yura Lee, <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, and Zhi Zheng </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Innovation in Aging</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab046.3428" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The World Population Prospects 2019 reports that the proportion of people who aged 65 and above takes up 9 per cent globally in 2019, reaching up to 16 per cent by 2050. Asia has the fastest rise: from 1 in 9 people aged 65 and above to 1 in 4 in 2050. Rapid growth in older adults has strong implications for diseases and healthcare expenditure. For Singapore, the transition from ‘ageing society’ (7% seniors) in 1999 to ‘super-aged society’ (20% seniors) in 2026 is projected to take 27 years, much faster than Japan’s 36 years. We used the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort (MEC) of 14,465 subjects aged 21 to 94, and the Future Elderly Model (FEM) microsimulation model to project disease burden and hospitalization expenditures to 2050. We found that Chinese females had the highest life expectancy of 86.0 years, followed by Indian and Malay females with 80.4 and 75.6 years respectively. In all racial groups, women lived longer than men by 5-7 years. Cumulative hospitalization expenditures of older adults aged 51+ was US69,500 for Chinese, US67,600 for Malays and US86,100 for Indians; US71,200 for males and US$70,700 for females. The increased hospitalization spending for all three ethnic groups was due to the underlying manifestation of chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Variations in environmental risk factors such as diet, cigarette smoking and physical activity across ethnic groups may contribute to racial differences in chronic diseases and disability. Therefore, targeted interventions are needed to reduce racial disparities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#1165D4"> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jhi" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HIJ</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2019mhealth" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">mHealth technologies for osteoarthritis self-management and treatment: A systematic review</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Hua Zheng, Patricia Franklin, and Bengisu Tulu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Health Informatics Journal</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1177/1460458217735676" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2019-HIJ.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Osteoarthritis is a common chronic disease that can be better treated with the help of self-management interventions.

We reviewed the current state of research and development of mHealth technologies for osteoarthritis self-management to determine gaps future research could address. We conducted a systematic review of English articles and a survey of apps available in the marketplace as of 2016. Among 117 unique articles identified, 25 articles that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed in-depth. The app search identified 23 relevant apps for osteoarthritis self-management. Through the synthesis of three research themes (osteoarthritis assessment tools, osteoarthritis measurement tools, and osteoarthritis motion monitoring tools) that emerged from the current knowledge base, we provide a design framework to guide the development of more comprehensive osteoarthritis mHealth apps that facilitate self-management, decision support, and shared decision-making.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.asist.org/meetings-events/am/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="wang2019assessing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing the informativeness of user reviews on mobile health applications for chronic diseases</div> <div class="author"> Shengang Wang, Hyun Seung Lee, and <em>Wonchan Choi</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.178" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/pra2.178" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>With advances in mobile health (mHealth) technology and growing ownership of smartphones, mHealth applications have great potential to support patients’ self-management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.

The interview data revealed that except for health care providers, a spouse or partner was mentioned as a credible interpersonal source of health information among older adults in a marital or romantic relationship. Characteristics of older adults’ health information behavior in the ELIS context were identified based on types of way of life and mastery of life. For example, those who had more varied types of hobbies, including cognitive, affective, and social hobbies, were exposed to diverse people as they performed their daily routine, potentially resulting in different sources of useful health information. In couple relationships, those with an optimistic as opposed to pessimistic attitude toward a problem-solving situation played the information provider role rather than information receiver role.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ConfProc</abbr> </div> <div id="tulu2017framework" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A framework to design mHealth apps for supporting self-management of chronic disease</div> <div class="author"> Bengisu Tulu, <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Hua Zheng, and Patricia Franklin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>2017 AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting</em>, 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://academyhealth.confex.com/academyhealth/2017arm/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/18194" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2017-AH-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Research Objective: We present a framework that guides the design of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) that support patients’ self-management of chronic health conditions and symptoms. Study Design: To assess the state of research and market place in utilizing mHealth technology for managing osteoarthritis (OA), a common chronic disease that causes considerable burden in terms of patients’ quality of life and costs for medical treatments, we conducted a systematic review on the literature and a survey of online app stores. Specifically, we conducted in-depth review of 25 articles that mentioned both mHealth technologies and OA management; we also analyzed 23 relevant apps for OA management available in the market place (e.g., Google Play). Population Studied: Literature and mobile apps for OA management Principal Findings: Based on our literature and app analyses, we suggest that three modules should be implemented in an app for any type of chronic disease including OA, namely (a) Self-Management, (b) Decision Support, and (c) Shared Decision-Making. The Self-Management module provides patients with the ability to quantify and log their disease progress and be better informed about the symptoms and available treatment options. OA patients, for example, can record pain levels on a regular basis using this module. The patient-reported data then should be used to generate useful feedback for patients. In addition, the app should provide educational content to improve patients’ understanding of their conditions in general and address potential questions patients might have regarding their symptoms and treatment options. The Decision Support module is the backend of the app where the expert knowledge and computational power should come into play to suggest evidence-based, data-driven treatment options for patients. This module should use patient-reported data fed by the Self-Management module of the app and patient-centered research outcomes reported in the literature to assess patients’ status from the medical treatment perspective. Furthermore, this data can be used to assess patients’ readiness for more advanced treatment options based on clinical evidence. Lastly, the Shared Decision-Making module should enable patients and clinicians to share data collected/generated using the Self-Management and Decision Support modules and to choose the ideal treatment together. To facilitate the shared decision-making process, the app should visualize patients’ progress in the disease management (e.g., trends of symptoms) as well as clinical assessment indices over a period of time. The app should present these results in detailed and summary forms targeting the needs of two user types (i.e., patients and clinicians). The app, therefore, can enable the patients and the clinicians to be in the same page in the supposedly long-term process of chronic disease treatment and help them reach a health care decision based on mutual agreement. Conclusions: The three modules described in the framework can work together to support patients’ self-management of chronic health conditions and symptoms. Implications for Policy or Practice: We believe this framework can help designers develop better mobile health apps that support patients’ self-management and informed shared decision-making in the treatment process with their clinicians.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://aisnet.org/page/AMCISPage" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMCIS</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2017effects" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of user interface design and task complexity level on user experience in an mHealth application</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Bengisu Tulu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>AMCIS 2017 Proceedings</em>, 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/Healthcare/Presentations/43/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2017-AMCIS-ERF-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2017-AMCIS-ERF-Slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>User interface (UI) is a crucial component of any application, including mHealth apps, as UI directly affects the user–app interaction, which then determines the concrete user experience with the app. This paper presents the results of an experimental study that examines the effects of data entry UI types and task complexity on user experience within the context of a mobile app. We used a 2 (touch technique: tap vs. slide) X 2 (target direction: vertical vs. horizontal) X 2 (task complexity: simple vs. complex) design.

For advanced knee arthritis patients, total knee replacement (TKR) is a surgical intervention that can effectively eliminate pain and improve physical function. Before choosing TKR, patients and clinicians must consider the risks and benefits of TKR and determine if the likely outcomes will meet the patient’s individual goals. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures have been widely used in orthopedic clinical research to summarize the patient’s arthritis pain severity and functional limitations before and after TKR. A national research registry, Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement (FORCE-TJR), successfully collected PRO measures from 13,000 primary TKR patients of over 150 surgeons in 28 states and disseminated aggregate comparative outcomes to participating hospitals and surgeons. To translate these outcomes to patients, an AHRQ-funded mHealth study is designing and testing a mobile app translating FORCE-TJR outcome data to provide knee arthritis patients with information and education about timing, value, and individualized likely outcomes from TKR to support patient and clinician shared treatment decision making. Methods: We developed an Android-based smart phone app for knee arthritis patients to assess arthritis symptoms and individual readiness for TKR surgery. Tailored, patient-centered outcome prediction models from the FORCE-TJR cohort provide refined outcome estimates. Patient focus groups and clinician interviews were conducted to obtain patients’ and clinicians’ feedback on their preferred graphic displays of data, questions, and evaluation results. Laboratory and field usability testing are beginning to finalize the app content and format. Findings: Three patient focus groups were conducted between December 2015 and February 2016. The preliminary findings from the focus groups revealed that the patients prefer easy tap user interfaces to multi-tap or slider methods, vertical question layout to horizontal orientation, and both numbered and worded rating scales to only using words. With input, a tailored report was designed with individual patient factors and trended pain and function history over time, based on FORCE-TJR data. Final clinician interviews are being conducted to evaluate the app’s shared report. Conclusions: An mHealth app was designed to disseminate tailored patient-centric outcome predictions developed from a contemporary national TKR cohort with refined usability and display features to meet the needs of knee arthritis patients faced with surgical treatment decisions. Dissemination of patient-reported symptoms and outcomes from recent TKR patients will support patient decision engagement and shared decision making for future knee arthritis patients. Lessons Learned: User input can inform the design and implementation of mHealth technology to deliver tailored knowledge to patients through a user-defined, patient-centered smart phone app. The tool will support future knee arthritis patient decisions regarding the need for, and timing of TKR surgery.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://aisnet.org/page/AMCISPage" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMCIS</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2016developing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Developing an mHealth application for osteoarthritis patients</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em>, Bengisu Tulu, Hua Zheng, and Patricia Franklin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>AMCIS 2016 Proceedings</em>, 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2016/Health/Presentations/25/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2016-AMCIS-ERF-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Given the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) and the potential usefulness of mHealth technologies for OA self-management and treatment decisions, the authors attempt to develop an mHealth App that is particularly focused on OA. As part of a larger project, the authors have conducted two focus groups exploring OA patients’ perceptions of pain data input user interfaces (UIs), pain scale, and requirements for the mHealth App on OA. The preliminary findings from the focus groups revealed that the patients preferred the Tap-Horizontal UI the most, while the Tap-Tap-Tap type of UIs were always rated lower than other types of UIs in the study. In regard to the pain scale, most participants highlighted that including numeric rating scales along with the corresponding wording would help them gauge their pain levels more accurately.

Application of the same evaluation metric to different domains, for instance, can produce unfair evaluation results, while analysis based on incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions. This study examines bibliometric data of library and information science (LIS) research in Korea to investigate whether research performance should be evaluated in a uniform manner in multi-disciplinary fields such as LIS and how data incompleteness can affect the bibliometric assessment outcomes. The initial analysis of our study data, which consisted of 4,350 citations to 1,986 domestic papers published between 2001 and 2010 by 163 LIS faculty members in Korea, showed an anomalous citation pattern caused by data incompleteness, which was addressed via data projection based on past citation trends. The subsequent analysis of augmented study data revealed ample evidence of bibliometric pattern differences across subject areas. In addition to highlighting the need for a subject-specific assessment of research performance, the study demonstrated the importance of rigorous analysis and careful interpretation of bibliometric data by identifying and compensating for deficiencies in the data source, examining per capita as well as overall statistics, and considering various facets of research in order to interpret what the numbers reflect rather than merely taking them at face value as quantitative measures of research performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.ischools.org/iconference" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iConf</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2015new-a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A new framework for Web credibility assessment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Besiki Stvilia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>iConference 2015 Proceedings</em>, 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/73945" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2015-iConf-Poster-Manu.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2015-iConf-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This poster reports on a study that used a literature analysis to develop a new, extended conceptual framework for Web credibility assessment.

In particular, it examined what sources students used to obtain wellness information, what wellness applications students used and for what purposes, how they learned about those applications, and what factors influenced their decision to choose a particular wellness application from multiple alternatives. The results indicated that students most often used websites as sources of wellness information, followed by mobile applications, family and friends, and then physicians. Students most often learned about wellness applications from search engines and application stores. Physicians were the least mentioned source of learning about mobile wellness applications. The most popular application type was calorie and activity trackers. In addition, when asked to rate the importance of various mobile application characteristics in their decision to select a particular wellness application, students rated usability-related characteristics the highest, followed by application cost and content quality. This study contributes to current research and practice in mobile wellness application design and the provision of mobile wellness services. In particular, it can inform application designers and intermediaries about which mobile wellness applications students use, and how students search for and select those applications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#1165D4"> <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23301643" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2015web" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Web credibility assessment: Conceptualization, operationalization, variability, and models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Besiki Stvilia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23543" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2015-JASIST.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This article reviews theoretical and empirical studies on information credibility, with particular questions as to how scholars have conceptualized credibility, which is known as a multifaceted concept with underlying dimensions; how credibility has been operationalized and measured in empirical studies, especially in the web context; what are the important user characteristics that contribute to the variability of web credibility assessment; and how the process of web credibility assessment has been theorized.

In particular, this research focuses on older adults as a research population as they are a less studied user group in the literature on information credibility. Considering the ever increasing presence of older adults on the Web and their needs for health information in their daily lives, this research explores older adults’ credibility assessment of online health information within the context of everyday life information seeking (ELIS). The methodology employed in this research consists of a qualitative meta-study (Phase I) and semi-structured interviews (Phase II). In Phase I, the researcher analyzed 84 primary research reports on information credibility, identifying conceptual typologies of important facets of credibility assessment such as conceptualization, operationalization, variability (user characteristics and contexts), and process. Based on these conceptual typologies, the researcher proposed a new, extended framework of Web credibility assessment, named WC framework, that contains three main components, Assessment of WC—i.e., conceptualization and operationalization to measure Web credibility; Variability of WC—i.e., variables regarding individual and context; and Process of WC—i.e., the overall process of Web credibility assessment. In Phase II, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty-one older adults whose ages ranged from 61 to 80 (M = 70.3) in the manner of one-on-one, in-person. The purposeful sampling methods, such as convenience sampling and snowball sampling, were used to recruit older adults who meet the sampling criteria of the study: age (55 years old or older), residency (Florida residents for an in-person interview), and Internet use experience. Also, a prescreen test was carried out via a telephone interview to make sure that the participant’s cognitive function was adequate for the study. Those who met all the sampling criteria and passed the prescreen test were recruited for an in-person interview which lasted around 45 minutes. The interview data revealed that older adults needed health/wellness information regarding medication and supplements, symptoms of and cures for specific diseases, medical quality assurance, health insurance, nutrition, and exercise. In seeking health information, they used both interpersonal and online sources. As for the interpersonal sources, the research participants mentioned medical professionals (e.g., doctors and physicians), partners, family, and friends. On the Web, they referenced information from non-profit (i.e., non-commercial) institutions’ websites such as government websites (e.g., NIH, CDC) and university hospitals’ websites (e.g., Johns Hopkins Medicine, Harvard Medical School). The most frequently mentioned commercial website was WebMD. Depending on the purposes of health information seeking, some interviewees mentioned that they used pharmacists’ websites (e.g., Walgreens and CVS). When judging the credibility of online health information, they employed various cues/markers and heuristics that are related to the attributes of the operator (i.e., source), content (i.e., message), and design (i.e., media) of Web resources. Based on the new framework developed in Phase I, the informants’ Web credibility assessment process was characterized with the two stages: initial and final evaluations. Lastly, both theoretical and empirical implications of the research and future research directions were discussed. Specifically, the new Web credibility assessment framework (i.e., the WC framework) advanced our understanding of the conceptualization of Web credibility and can be used as a knowledge resource in developing context specific credibility assessment models as well as information system interfaces that provide effective support for information credibility evaluation by users. Likewise, findings from the semi-structured interviews can inform online information system developers and librarians about how older users search for online health information and how they assess its credibility. Ultimately, the findings of this research should help the development of more effective online systems, services, and, training modules that are aligned with the online information behaviors of this rapidly growing, important user population—i.e., older adults.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.ischools.org/iconference" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iConf</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2014collegechoose" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">College Students’ Value Structure of Choosing and Using Mobile Health/Wellness Applications: Preliminary Findings</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Besiki Stvilia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>iConference 2014 Proceedings</em>, 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/47352" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2014-iConf-Poster-Manu.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2014-iConf-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This work-in-progress poster reports on the preliminary findings regarding college students’ value structure of how to choose and utilize mobile health/wellness applications. We have conducted surveys and follow-up interviews with college students who have been using mobile health/wellness applications. In this poster, we analyzed the survey data from sixteen participants and the interview data from five participants (three females and two males). The analysis showed that the most important purposes of using mobile health/wellness applications for college students were recording and managing personal health information/records and keeping up with their fitness plans. For selection criteria, easy to navigate, easy to use, quality of content, customizability, and ratings from other users seemed to play the most important role in college students’ choices of certain mobile applications among alternatives.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#32c96f"> <a href="https://www.asist.org/meetings-events/am/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ASIST</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="choi2014college" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How do college students choose mobile health/wellness applications?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Wonchan Choi</em> and Besiki Stvilia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>, 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/meet.2014.14505101115" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2014-ASIST-Poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This poster reports on the findings from interviews with fifty college students regarding what mobile health and wellness applications students used and how they choose those applications.
