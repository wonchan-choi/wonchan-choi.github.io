I am an associate professor at the [School of Information Studies](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/), [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu/). My research aims to better understand and improve how people seek, use, and create information to accomplish various goals in their daily lives. Taking a human-centered approach, I study information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, with the goal of generating insights that benefit both academic research and real-world applications.

My current projects focus on developing:

* **A framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy and an associated toolkit** to support the creation of educational materials and programs that help college students engage effectively and ethically with GenAI tools in higher education.
* **A scale to assess the credibility of online information** in increasingly complex digital environments, where content is often produced by anonymous users and AI bots.
* **Design guidelines for mobile digital libraries** to improve accessibility and usability for blind and visually impaired users.
