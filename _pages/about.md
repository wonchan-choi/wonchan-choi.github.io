The goal of my research is to better understand and improve how people seek, use, and create information. 

Taking a human-centered approach, I study information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, and contribute to the design of information systems and services that align with users’ needs and behaviors.

My current projects aims to produce outcomes that contribute to not only academia but also practice. In particular, I work on developing:

-  **A theoretical framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy  and an associated toolkit** to support the development of educational materials and programs to enhance college students' GenAI literacy
-  **A psychometric scale to measure the credibility of online information** in today’s evolving environments, where content generated by anonymous users and AI bots circulates widely
-  **Guidelines for designing mobile digital libraries tailored to blind and visually impaired users**
