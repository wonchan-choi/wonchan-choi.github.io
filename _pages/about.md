Welcome to my website!

I am an associate professor at the School of Information Studies at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Taking a human-centered approach, my research aims to enhance people's information-related activies, such as seeking, using, and creating information, by (a) studying their information behaviors in technology-meidated information envrionments, such as the web and artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered information systems, and (b) designing usable and accessible information systems and services. 

My current projects focus on: 
- Developing a theoretical framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy and an associated toolkit that can be used to develop educatioin materials and programs
- Developing a psychometric scale to measure the cedibility of online information on current and newly emerging information envrionemnts where content generated by anonymous users and AI bots are being circulated
- Developing guidelines for desinging digital libraries on mobile platforms for blind and visual imparied users
