**Welcome to my website!**

I am an associate professor in the [School of Information Studies, the iSchool, at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (UWM)](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/). Guided by a human-centered approach, my research aims to improve how people seek, use, and create information. I do this by (a) studying information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, and (b) designing usable and accessible information systems and services.

My current projects include:

- Developing a theoretical framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy, along with a toolkit to support educational materials and programs
- Creating a psychometric scale to measure the credibility of online information in today’s evolving environments, where content generated by anonymous users and AI bots circulates widely
- Designing guidelines for mobile digital libraries tailored to blind and visually impaired users
