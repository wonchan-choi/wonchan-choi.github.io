Welcome to my website!

I am an associate professor in the [School of Information Studies, the iSchool, at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (UWM)](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/). The goal of my research is to better understand and improve how people seek, use, and create information. 

My research takes a human-centered approach to examine information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, and contribute the design of information systems and services aligned with the needs of users.

My current projects focus on developing a theoretical framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy, along with a toolkit to support educational materials and programs; creating a psychometric scale to measure the credibility of online information in today’s evolving environments, where content generated by anonymous users and AI bots circulates widely; and designing [guidelines for mobile digital libraries tailored to blind and visually impaired users](https://sites.uwm.edu/mdlaug/).
