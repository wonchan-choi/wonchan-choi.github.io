My research aims to better understand and improve how people seek, use, and create information to accomplsih various goals in their daily lives. Taking a human-centered approach, I study information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, with the goal of generating insights that beneift both academic research and real-world applications. 

My current projects focus on developing:

**A framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy and an associated toolkit** to support the creation of educational materials and programs that help college students engage effectively and ethcially with GenAI tools in the higher education context. 

**A scale to assess the credibility of online information** in increasingly complex digital environments, where content is often prodcued by anonymous users and AI bots.

**Design guidelines for mobile digital libraries** to improve accessiblity and usability for blind and visually impaired users.
