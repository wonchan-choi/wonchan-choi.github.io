The goal of my research is to better understand and improve how people seek, use, and create information. 

Taking a human-centered approach, I study information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, and contribute to the design of information systems and services that align with usersâ€™ needs and behaviors. My current projects aims to produce outcomes that beneift both academic research and real-world applications. Specifically, I'm working on developing: (a) **a theoretical framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy  and an associated toolkit** to support the creation of educational materials and programs that help college students engage effectively and ethcially with GenAI tools in the higher education context; (b) **a psychometric scale to assess the credibility of online information** in increasingly complex digital environments, where content is often prodcued by anonymous users and AI bots; and (c) **design guidelines for mobile digital libraries to improve accessiblity and usability for blind and visually impaired users**.
