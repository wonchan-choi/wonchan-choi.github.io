Guided by a human-centered approach, my research aims to improve how people seek, use, and create information. I do this by (a) studying information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, and (b) designing usable and accessible information systems and services.</p> <p>My current projects include:</p> <ul> <li>Developing a theoretical framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy, along with a toolkit to support educational materials and programs</li> <li>Creating a psychometric scale to measure the credibility of online information in today’s evolving environments, where content generated by anonymous users and AI bots circulates widely</li> <li>Designing guidelines for mobile digital libraries tailored to blind and visually impaired users</li> </ul> </body></html>
