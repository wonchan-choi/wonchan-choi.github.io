My research aims to better understand and improve how people seek, use, and create information to accomplish various goals in their daily lives. Taking a human-centered approach, I study information behavior in technology-mediated environments, such as the web and AI-powered systems, with the goal of generating insights that benefit both academic research and real-world applications.</p> <p>My current projects focus on developing:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>A framework for generative AI (GenAI) literacy and an associated toolkit</strong> to support the creation of educational materials and programs that help college students engage effectively and ethically with GenAI tools in higher education.</li> <li> <strong>A scale to assess the credibility of online information</strong> in increasingly complex digital environments, where content is often produced by anonymous users and AI bots.</li> <li> <strong>Design guidelines for mobile digital libraries</strong> to improve accessibility and usability for blind and visually impaired users.</li> </ul> </body></html>
